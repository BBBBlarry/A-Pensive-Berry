On Gender Equality

A Glimpse at Germany’s Gender Equality Through the Book Thief in early 1900s

Nowadays, female-led gender equality society revisions are progressing unbelievably mightily. As many scholars have agreed on, the spark of this movement, or evolution, was first lit in the first half of the last century due to the short supply of domestic labor during the wars. Germany, as a belligerent state of both world wars, well exemplifies women’s right’s expansion and some struggles. The embryo of rising power of feminine roles before and post World War II is ubiquitously mentioned in the novel, The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak though different female characters. Liesel, Rosa, and Frau, each represents female teenagers, female working class and female from a sumptuous family during this evolution.

The most drastic changes of roles which far more surpass every other representations, occurred on teenage girls. Since Meminger’s first days, she “spent her time playing soccer with Rudy and the other kids on Himmel Street” (Zusak 50). There are neither restrictions or any other forms of disapproval for Liesel to be surrounded by the boys, nor playing soccer with them. Hence the parents, the society, and most importantly, the teenagers themselves do not have any discomforts that boys interacting with girls. In some countries at the time, i.e. China, there were strict rules and invisible walls between young males and females, where boys can go to school and play with boys, yet leaving girls home and sew, lingering a drastic taste of contrast to Germany. At another glimpse of the novel, Liesel also stole apples with “a group of five boys” (Zusak  102). She “stood below [the tree], putting [apples] into sack“ (Zusak 103). while “[Rudy] made his way up the closest tree and started flinging down the apples.” (Zusak 103). Obviously Liesel is willing to do such a “muscular” activity with the boys, showing individuals in the society have been passed on the hammer to break the traditions. It makes Liesel, along with her behaviours, an exceptional exemplar of gender equality in the 40s. 

Shift to an older generation at the same time period. Markus portrayed a very “unconventional” working class family where the woman is the power house. Rosa Hubermann, Liesel’s foster mother, is described as a “woman with an iron fist” (Zusak 27). For example, when Hans Hubermann went out to play accordion, Rosa made quite a scene. 

As he walked up Himmel Street, Mama would open the window and cry out, “Don’t be home too late!” 
“Not so loud,” he would turn and call back.
“Saukerl! Lick my ass! I’ll speak as loud as I want!”  (Zusak 29)

The bold and aggressive traits that Rosa has imprinted quite an impact in readers’ minds. Her image twisted a traditional family’s stereotype which man is the absolute power. Therefore, she is an great exemplar of women’s rising power. Rosa had also complained to Liesel: “And here I am, walking the streets and slaving in my kitchen that Saukerl never has any work” (Zusak 31). As seen, Rosa is also taking the role of a man in a family. Although Hans, her husband, is a very good foster father, who read books, played accordion musics to Liesel to make her more comfortable with the family, Rosa took the man’s traditional responsibilities to feed and to work for every family member. 

In higher class, the traits of women’s rights yet progress a trivial amount. Frau Hermann, the mayor’s wife, despite her love to Liesel and her family’s sumptuousness, still has to fire Liesel as her cloth cleaner, acquiescing her husband’s decision. She had to hand Liesel the letter that “Mayor Heinz Hermann diplomatically outlined” (Zusak 179). It seems that in a higher class German family, the husband has the right to decide a family discussion’s outcome, which is quite surprisingly contrasting from Hans and Rosa’s family. Frau also does not have a job. Instead, Frau would “[open] the door… like she normally would” (Zusak 90) every washing day, and just sits and reads the rest her time. Alike the tradition of “women should stay home and comfort men”, Frau’s situation is bonded to a male-oriented family structure, restricting her own moves and potential contribution to the family. 

In short, female teenager, Liesel, working class female, Rosa, and the mayor’s wife, Frau showed the different stages and structures of a female rising power family’s embryo in the 1940s. Liesel, through her freedom in choice of activities, the readers can see her doubtless interactions with the opposite gender. Rosa portraying an absolute power at home who also works and feeds the family, embraces a completely bold and aggressive progress in gender equality. Yet the mayor’s wife, Frau Hermann, showed a more conservative side of the evolution. Along with the progresses, and traditional struggles, gender equality was slowly born and started its growth since then. Sources
