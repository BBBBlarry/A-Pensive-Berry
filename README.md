Long time ago, there was a berry hanging on a tree. It was contemplating, so deeply, determining whether every life has its significant value. A farmer spotted the juicy berry. Without hesitation, he picked it from the tree and bit it, omitting somewhat satisfaction.

Hmmmm, I guess every life does have its significant value.
